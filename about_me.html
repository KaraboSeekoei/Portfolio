        Hello! I’m Karabo Seekoei, a dedicated web developer and software engineer
        with a passion for crafting beautiful and functional digital experiences.
        Over the years, I have honed my skills in both frontend and backend
        development, working with various technologies to build scalable and
        maintainable applications.
        I believe that technology should empower people, which is why I focus on
        creating intuitive user interfaces and seamless interactions. Outside of
        coding, I enjoy exploring creative pursuits, learning new frameworks, and
        collaborating with others to solve challenging problems.
        <br /><br />
